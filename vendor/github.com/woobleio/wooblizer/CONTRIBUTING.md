# How to contribute?

Wooblizer is the part of the project for parsing the creation and which defines Wooble's API. The [Wooble platform](https://www.wooble.io) source code is private
but it uses Wooblizer as a dependency. If you're not sure your issue or suggestion is about the platform or Wooblizer, do not hesitate to post your issue here, I will
sort it out.

Wooble uses [Github issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to track bugs and to track suggestions or questions.

## Submitting bug report

* Use a __clear and descriptive__ title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe how you got the issue you want to report. If you encountered the issue by using Wooblizer, show the code that triggers the error, the engine you used,
your creations source code. If you encountered the issue by using the platform, be descriptive as possible, tell use which browser you use, which version and what
you did to encounter the issue.
